##Blackjack

- Blackjack is a game of chance and skill, and in this exciting version of the game, one player is pitted against the dealer
- The aim of the game is to obtain a higher score than the dealer, without going over 21
- There are several general rules of the game whose logic are built into the app:
  * The dealer must hit on a 16 and stand on a 17
  * An ace can be used as a 1 or an 11, and the logic automatically decides when one or the other is appropriate
  * A blackjack on the initial deal pays 3/2 odds
  * A tie or push results in the bet being returned to the player
- Enhanced functionality will be included in later versions of the app, such as the ability to "split", or play two separate hands when dealt two of the same number, and "double-down", or double your bet and receive one additional card.
- The app is available on laptop, desktop, iPhone and iPad
